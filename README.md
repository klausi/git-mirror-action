# Git Mirror Action

A GitHub Action for [mirroring a git repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository-in-another-location) to another location via SSH.

## Inputs

### `source-repo`

**Required** SSH URLs of the source repo.

### `destination-repo`

**Required** SSH URLs of the destination repo.

## Environment variables

`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Create a [SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) which has access to both repositories. On GitHub they are called "deploy keys". Store [the private key as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) and use it in your workflow as seen in the example usage below.

If you added the private key in an [environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments) make sure to [reference the environment name in your workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenvironment) otherwise the secret is not passed to the workflow.


## Example workflow

```
name: Mirror to Bitbucket Repo
